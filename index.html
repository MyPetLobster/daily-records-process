            <h3>Project Process</h3>
            <p class="process-description">
                I will be keeping track of my process as I create the project and constantly updating the information below. I started 
                making these process.html files with BookcaseDatabase.com, and I've found it incredibly useful for reinforcing concepts 
                I'm learning and giving me a reference for future projects. I'm hoping to do the same with this project.

            <h3>Initial Brainstorming, Choosing a Database Management System</h3>
            <p>
                I wanted to create a project that I would actually use on a daily basis. I have a folder in my Notes app on my
                phone where I keep track of my work hours, school hours, and other things I'm learning. My current process is 
                every few days I open Google Maps and look at my timeline to see where I was and what I was doing. Then I open 
                my Notes app and create a new note with the date and time and write down what I was doing. Then when it comes time 
                to send invoices I have to go through all of my notes one by one and add up the hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started taking programming courses on August 24, 2023. Since then, I've been keeping track of the hours I've put 
                in each day and the things I've been learning. I guess I just have a thing for keeping records. I decided to make a 
                project that would replace my Notes app folder and make it easier for me to keep track of my hours and what I'm
                learning. I also wanted to make it easy to export the data to CSV and generate invoices automatically. I'd like to 
                be able to see totals and summaries of my hours spent at specific jobs or working on specific projects.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I opted to give MySQL a try. But in the process I learned a bit about the differences between MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
                and SQLite. I realized that SQLite would probably be the best option for a simple single-user project like this. But I 
                also realized that SQLite was NOT the RDBMS to use for my last big project, Bookcase Database. Luckily, I currently have 
                three total users -- me, my aunt, and my friend. So I should be okay for now. However, I'm thinking that I will migrate 
                Bookcase Database from SQLite to MySQL or PostgreSQL in the future. So I decided to try using MySQL for this project to 
                get comfortable with it. PostgreSQL seemed like overkill for this and even Bookcase Database. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Took a minute because of issues with the PATH but I got MySQL installed and a server running. Using MySQL seems like it 
                will be very straightforward. Now that I have that installed and ready to roll, I'm going to start planning the database 
                itself.

            <h3>Database Design</h3>
            <p>
                I decided to start visually. I found a website <a href="https://online.visual-paradigm.com/">Visual-Paradigm</a> where I could 
                create a free account and create a visual ERD. I started with the basics. I created a table for Days, Clients, Jobs, Work Hours,
                Learning Hours, Expenses and Invoices. 
            </p>
            <h5>Here is what my ERD diagram...(entity relationship diagram, diagram?) looks like as of now</h5>

                I thought through all the relationships between tables to make sure it all made sense. I decided to add a table for Courses and 
                a table for Projects.

                As you can see, I've created the relationships between the tables using association tables (aka junction tables, join tables,

            <h3>Creating the database</h3>
            <p>Time to translate the ERD to a schema.sql file.</p>
            <p>
                I started by reading through the startup guides on MySQL.com. Most of the syntax and commands are very similar or identical to 
                those used in SQLite, so that wasn't hard to get familiar with. I started by translating the ERD to a schema.sql file. 
                Once I had a first draft done, I went and asked my GPT friend to look it over for me. They gave me some feedback suggesting that 
                I look into foreign key constraints and normalization. I was somewhat familiar with both of these terms, and I know we went over 
                them in the course, but I had to do some research to refresh my memory. 
            </p>
            <h4>Foreign Key Constraints</h4>
            <p>
                In summary the purpose of foreign key constraints is to ensure that the data in the database is consistent. It ensures that 
                the data in one table matches the data in another table. For example, if I have a table of clients and a table of jobs, I want
                to make sure that the client_id in the jobs table matches the client_id in the clients table. If I delete a client, I want to 
                make sure that all of the jobs associated with that client are also deleted.
            </p>
            <h4>Normalization</h4>
            <p>
                Normalization is a term I was already familiar with in the context of audio engineering. It's the process of making sure that
                the volume of a track is consistent throughout the track, or in line with another target or standard. In the context of
                databases, normalization is the process of organizing the data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First Normal Form (1NF): Each cell in a table must contain only one piece of information, and there should be no duplicate 
                    rows.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Second Normal Form (2NF): Meet all the requirements of 1NF, and every non-key column must be fully dependent on the table's 
                    primary key (not just a part of it).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third Normal Form (3NF): Meet all the requirements of 2NF, and there should be no columns that are indirectly dependent on 
                    the primary key (i.e., no transitive dependencies).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
                I also downloaded the MySQL Workbench app and imported my schema and created an ERD with that tool. I found it very useful to 
                be able to include some more information about the values in each table in the diagram. Here is that diagram:

            <h3>Implementing the Database and Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                I ran into trouble because of the order in which I was adding tables to the database. In retrospect, it seems 
                pretty obvious that I need to add a table before I can reference it in another table. But I was trying to add 
                the tables in the order that they appeared in the ERD. I was getting errors like "ERROR 1215 (HY000): Cannot add
                foreign key constraint". But what's a good project without a little debugging. Got that sorted out then spent some 
                more time adjusting the schema and ERD. I kept getting the one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships 
                mixed up in my head. But something finally started clicking for me by the end of this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to do some googling about stored procedures and I actually added a few to the database. I created a stored 
                procedure to add all the relevant information for a work time block and a learning time block. I also went through something
                iterations with my query to generate an invoice. I'm still not sure if I'm doing it the best way, but I'm happy with the 
                results. I'm able to generate an invoice for a client that includes all the relevant information.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with the CS50 Python final project that I recently completed, I decided to stop myself from taking the project 
                further before submitting. However, I've already begun working on implementing my Python chatbot into my Bookcase 
                Database website, and I intend to actually use this project, Daily Records. So in my spare time I will be working 
                on building a GUI to make it easier to input data. Perhaps I'll even make it a web app. But I'm eager to continue 
                learning and not get bogged down by my perfectionism and desire to make everything perfect before I move on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just cleaned up the code and made a final pass on my ER diagrams and recorded the submission video for my project.
